# Soufflé Keyboard

Soufflé is 6×4+1+4+1 keys column-staggered split keyboard with encoder support, based on the [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) and re-inspired by the [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) keyboards. It also takes a bit of design ideas from the Kyria.

Soufflé was created by [Jesus Climent](https://https://github.com/climent/).

## Firmware 

Soufflé uses [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/)

## Default layout 

Soufflé uses a similar layout than the Sofle, with a full 6x5 matrix, and the encoders connected to the same pins.
