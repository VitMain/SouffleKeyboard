# Soufflé Keyboard

Soufflé vR is 6×4+1+4+1 keys column-staggered split keyboard with encoder support, based on the [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) RGB version, and re-inspired by the [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) keyboard.

Soufflé was created by [Jesus Climent](https://https://github.com/climent/).

Key features:

*   Palm key at the bottom of the outer pinky column.
*   2x rotary encoders.
*   Original RGB features were removed.
*   Exposed pins for roller encoder on the upper case plate. 
*   More (to be listed).

## Firmware 

Soufflé uses [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/) and it is fully compatible with the Sofle firmware.

## Default layout 

Soufflé uses a similar layout than the Sofle, with a full 6x5 matrix, and the encoders connected to the same pins. The main difference is the position of the outermost thumb key, which has been moved to the bottom of the pinky column, to be used with the palm.
