# Soufflé Keyboard

Soufflé v1 is 6×4+1+4+1 keys column-staggered split keyboard with encoder support, based on the [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) and re-inspired by the [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) keyboards.

Soufflé was created by [Jesus Climent](https://https://github.com/climent/).

Key changes compared to the Sofle V1:

*   Palm key at the bottom of the outer pinky column.

## Firmware 

Soufflé uses [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/) and it is fully compatible with the Sofle firmware.

## Default layout 

Soufflé uses a similar layout than the Sofle, with a full 6x5 matrix, and the encoders connected to the same pins. The main difference is the position of the outermost thumb key, which has been moved to the bottom of the pinky column, to be used with the palm.
